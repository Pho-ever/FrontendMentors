# Frontend Mentor - Chat app CSS illustration

![Design preview for the Chat app CSS illustration coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for checking out this front-end coding challenge that participated in 

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.


## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this feature illustration using HTML & CSS and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The only assets provided in this challenge were the image of the person in the app UI and the 3 images of the dog. 

## The Difficulties i faced 

I made use of CSS Grid while developing the parent div, I made a few mistakes and had to refactor from time to time

I am not done with the entire challenge but i am making progress 

I am finding it difficult to make the body on the right overlay on the design at the moment 

I probably would have to refactor the code later on






## Deploying the project challenge

Ii will be hosting this project for free and the recommended hosts were:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)




**Thank you** ðŸš€
